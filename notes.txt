When developing with the MERN stack (Mongodb, Express, React, Node) is this method of authentication secure?

1) User inputs email and password in the Front End

2) Email and password are sent to the backend 

3) Password is authenticated using bcrypt to compare it to the passwordHash stored in Mongodb. 

4) If password is correct, Token is generate using express-jwt (JSON WEB TOKEN)

5) Token is sent to front end

6) Token is saved in local storage and keeps user logged in. Token is used to access private routes in React. 

7) If user logs out, then local storage is cleared of token
